# 🌱 CSIRO – Image2Biomass Prediction

## 📌 Problem Statement
Farmers frequently face a crucial question:  
**“Is there enough grass in the paddock for the herd?”**

Pasture biomass—the amount of available feed—plays a vital role in grazing management, animal welfare, productivity, and soil sustainability. Incorrect estimation can lead to overgrazing, wasted feed, and land degradation.

Traditional methods such as *clip and weigh* are accurate but slow and impractical at scale. Sensor-based tools and remote sensing methods offer speed but struggle with reliability, validation, and species-level differentiation.

## 🎯 Objective
This project is part of the **CSIRO – Image2Biomass Prediction** Kaggle competition.  
The goal is to build a **machine learning model** that predicts pasture biomass using:
- Ground-level pasture images
- Ground-truth biomass measurements
- Publicly available datasets
- NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) values

The model must generalize across:
- Different seasons
- Multiple Australian regions
- Mixed pasture species compositions

---

## 📊 Dataset
The dataset includes:
- Professionally annotated pasture images
- Ground-truth biomass measurements
- NDVI values
- Data collected across varying environmental conditions

📌 *Dataset provided by CSIRO via Kaggle.*

## 🛠️ Methodology
The project follows a standard data science pipeline:

1. Data loading and preprocessing  
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
3. Feature engineering using image data and NDVI  
4. Model training and validation  
5. Performance evaluation and error analysis  

---

## 📈 Evaluation Metric
Model performance is evaluated using **regression-based metrics** as defined in the competition, such as:
- RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error)
- MAE (Mean Absolute Error)

---

## 🌍 Impact
Accurate pasture biomass prediction enables:
- Smarter grazing decisions for farmers
- Improved animal welfare and productivity
- Sustainable land and pasture management
- Better monitoring of pasture health over time

This work supports the agricultural industry in moving toward **data-driven and environmentally sustainable systems**.
